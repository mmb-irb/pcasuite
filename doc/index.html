    <h2><a name='Abstract'>Abstract</a></h2>
      <p>
        This program suite allows the user to compress Molecular Dynamics
        (<acronym title='Molecular Dynamics'>MD</acronym>) trajectories using
        Principal Component Analysis
        (<acronym title='Principal Component Analysis'>PCA</acronym>)
        algorithms. This technique offers a good compression ratio at the
        expense of losing some precision in the trajectory.
      </p>

      <h2><a name='Overview'>Overview</a></h2>
      <p>
        People working with Molecular Dynamics simulations know that the output
        files of their work are huge. But they need to save their work for later
        study and available space disappears quickly. Traditional general
        compression algorithms like
        <acronym title='Lempel-Ziv-Welch'>LZW</acronym> has been used in order
        to reduce the required space, but they usually does not perform well
        with this kind of data. But we know that this data is no random, it
        follows a pattern and has a well defined meaning which we can exploit
        in our effort to reduce the size of the data. We also know that most of
        the time, we does not need to store all the details. Higher frequency
        movements can be due to temperature or other irrelevant factors for some
        kinds of analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
        This knowledge points us towards the use of
        <acronym title='Principal Component Analysis'>PCA</acronym> techniques.
        This methods try to change the coordinate space of the system being
        analyzed to capture the maximum amount of variance with the minimum
        effort. This methods also allows us to select the degree of fidelity to
        the original trajectory that we need, so if we need a very accurate
        trajectory, we can choose not to compress so much the data in order to
        have more detail.
      </p>
      <p>
        Principal Component Analysis is a technique used to reduce the
        dimensionality of a dataset. It is an orthogonal linear transformation
        that transforms data into a new coordinate system such that the greatest
        variance by any projection of the data lays on the first coordinate,
        the second greatest variance lays on the second and so on. When we get
        the first coordinates, we are getting the movements that contribute most
        to the variance of that dataset. In that case, the least coordinates can
        be ignored because their contribution is very low, hence we store less
        information but the analysis can be performed in the same way.
      </p>

    <h2><a name='Operation'>Operation</a></h2>
      <p>
        There are different ways to apply this technique. I will explain the
        method used by this suite.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's suppose we have a <acronym title='Molecular Dynamics'>MD</acronym>
        trajectory of N atoms and F frames. The first action is to prepare the
        input for the real processing and compression. We must recenter the
        different snapshots onto a representative structure in order to have a
        good compression. This action is performed in three steps:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Recenter all the snapshots of the trajectory onto the first one</li>
        <li>Compute the mean snapshot after the first recentering step</li>
        <li>Recenter all the snapshots onto the computed mean</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The recentering is performed looking for the best
        <acronym title='Root Mean Squared deviation'>RMSd</acronym> fit.
        This value can be computed using two different algorithms:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A standard, Kabsch-based,
        <acronym title='Root Mean Squared deviation'>RMSd</acronym>
        algorithm</li>
        <li>A Gaussian algorithm that gives more weight to the still atoms and
        less weight to the moving atoms</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The gaussian algorithm may help to reduce the number of eigenvectors
        needed for a given compression, thus reducing the size of the compressed
        file. The gaussian algorithm also allows for other analysis, like the
        hinge point prediction, much more difficult and imprecise using a
        standard <acronym title='Root Mean Squared deviation'>RMSd</acronym>
        algorithm.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first step is to compute the covariance matrix of the trajectory,
        where the random variables are the coordinates of the N atoms. This
        leads to a symmetric square matrix of 3N*3N dimensions. Once we have
        this matrix we diagonalize it in order to get the associated eigenvalues
        and eigenvectors. It turns out that the sum of all the eigenvalues is
        the total variance of the trajectory, and the individual eigenvalues is
        the variance quantity explained by the corresponding eigenvector.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this data we can select and save enough eigenvectors to preserve an
        arbitrary amount of variance and discard the ones that give us little to
        no information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the eigenvectors has been selected, a projection of the original
        data into the new coordinate space must be performed. The final output
        of the algorithm must contain the mean structure, the eigenvectors and
        the projections in order to restore the original file. Our suite also
        stores some other kind of information like the eigenvalues and the atom
        names to allow us to perform the analysis and manipulations in a quick
        and more flexible way.
      </p>

  <h2><a name='FileFormats'>File formats</a></h2>
    <p>
      Through the evolution of this code, the format used by the compressed
      files has changed along time. This suite works natively with the
      <em>PCZ4</em> format, but it also supports reading of files written in
      <em>PCZ2</em> and <em>PCZ3</em> formats. All the formats are binary-based,
      being the PCZ2 and PCZ3 very similar and PCZ4 adding new features.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most important difference between PCZ2/3 and PCZ4 is the lack of the
      atom names in the former. This makes impossible to use
      <a href='#MaskStrings'>masks</a> to select atoms.
    </p>

  <h2><a name='Installation'>Installation</a></h2>
    <p>
      The code is quite standard so no difficult steps will be needed. In the
      first place, you need to download the tarball from
      <a href='http://mmb.pcb.ub.es/software/pcasuite.tar.gz'>pcasuite.tar.gz</a>.
      Once we have the tarball, we must uncompress it, enter into the newly
      created <code>pcazip</code> folder and compile the source with
      <code>make</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prior to executing the compilation we must choose a compiler and adjust
      the Makefile with the proper flags. This is done through the
      <code>config.mk</code> file. This file is a soft link to a file with the
      proper flags. Some files for different compilers are provided:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>config.gcc3</code> for the GCC v3 compiler series</li>
      <li><code>config.gcc4</code> for the GCC v4 compiler series</li>
      <li><code>config.intel</code> for the Intel compilers</li>
      <li><code>config.xlc</code> for the IBM xl compilers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There is a default link to compile with GCC v4. In summary, the steps
      needed to compile the application are:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><kbd>$ wget http://mmb.pcb.ub.es/software/pcasuite.tar.gz</kbd></li>
      <li><kbd>$ tar xf pcasuite.tar.gz</kbd></li>
      <li><kbd>$ cd pcasuite</kbd></li>
      <li><kbd>$ rm config.mk</kbd></li>
      <li><kbd>$ ln -s config.gcc4 config.mk</kbd></li>
      <li><kbd>$ make</kbd></li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      This procedure compiles the source code and leave the binaries in the same
      folder. This binaries can be moved to a proper place to be executed
      easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some adjustment may be required in order to have the code compiled if the
      libraries required are not stored in standard paths. A local 
      <code>config.mk</code> file can be generated to adapt the compiler to the
      computer where the suite is being compiled.

  <h2><a name='MaskStrings'>Mask Strings</a></h2>
    <p>
      Mask strings has been implemented to allow the users to specify the
      atoms that must be used in a compression or analysis with ease, concisely
      and without having to generate more files. They have a syntax very
      similar to that used by Amber utilities but slightly different to allow
      for greater flexibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      The masks are composed of atom and residue specifications and the
      connectors between them. Atoms are preceded by <em>@</em> and residues
      by <em>:</em>. After one of those symbols comes the atom/residue
      specification. It can come in numerical form, giving the atom or residue
      number, or in alphabetical form, giving the atom or residue name.
      Multiple specifications can be separated by commas, and when using
      numeric specifications, ranges can be created by using dashes.
      Some examples:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>@C</code> represents all the Carbon atoms</li>
      <li><code>:GLY</code> represents all the glycine residues</li>
      <li><code>:1-10</code> represents the first 10 residues</li>
      <li><code>@C,CA,N,O</code> represents all the atoms belonging to the
      backbone</li>
      <li><code>@2-5,7,9,15-30</code> represents all the atoms numbered from 2
      to 5, 7, 9 and from 15 to 30</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      All of this specifications can be combined by means of logical
      constructions and parenthesis. Logical AND (<code>&amp;</code>), logical
      OR (<code>|</code>) and logical NOT (<code>~</code>) can be used and
      combined. With this constructions we can ask for the residue 3 and the
      atom 300 but not the atom 150 with this line:
      <code>:3&amp;@300&amp;~@150</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      The is also the chance of using wildcards to complete the names of atoms
      and residues, so we can select all the Hydrogens with <code>@H*</code>.
      More examples follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>:10-20&amp;~@CA,C,N,O</code> represents the sidechains of the
      residues 10 thru 20</li>
      <li><code>:GLY|(@O*,N*&amp;~:GLU)</code> represents all the GLY residues
      along with all the Oxygen and Nitrogen atoms that does not belong to GLU
      residue</li>
      <li><code>@O*&amp;~:GLY</code> represents all the Oxygen atoms that does
      not belong to a Glycine</li>
    </ul>

  <h2><a name='Parallelism'>Parallelism in PCAzip</a></h2>
  	<p>
  		PCAzip is the most time-consuming application of the suite.
  		The more consuming routines of the algorithm are the covariance matrix
  		generation and the eigenvector calculus.
  		This routines has been targeted for parallelization witn MPI, the
  		standard paradigm for distributed memory parallelization of code.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		The paralellization of the eigenvector computation has been achieved
  		through the use of the <a href="http://www.netlib.org/scalapack">ScaLAPACK
  		library</a>, which is a highly optimized and portable library written
  		in Fortran.
  		Most hardware vendors offer their own optimized version for its own
  		machines.
  		The parallelization method of ScaLAPACK has been through MPI for
  		distributed memory machines, which has conditioned the decision of
  		using MPI for the parallelization of the covariance matrix calculus.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		The parallelization of the covariance matrix computation has been done
  		with MPI because the ScaLAPACK library use this methodology, but also
  		because is a more scalable technology than the ones for shared memory
  		machines like OpenMP.
  		Using shared memory machines we are limited to use only the processors
  		physically present on the machine.
  		No connection to other networked processors can be done.
  		Using a distributed memory approach this limitation is overcomed and
  		remote processors can be used, for example, the ones of a computer
  		cluster.
  		The parallelization effort is greater in the message passing paradigm,
  		but it compensates by its scalability.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		After benchmarking the resulting code, we can see that the covariance
  		matrix calculation scales really well, although the eigenvector
  		calculation shows a poorer performance.
  		This means that we must choose carefully the number of processors in
  		order not to waste resources.
  		If the matrix covariance calculus is expected to be heavier than the
  		diagonalization, then more processors can be added without fear.
  		But if the diagonalization process is the most time-consuming, then we
  		must adjust the number of processors for a good efficiency of this step.

  <h2><a name='DeveloperInformation'>Information for developers</a></h2>
    <p>
      The source code of PCAzip utility has been prepared to support multiple
      input file formats. This has been achieved through a file recognition
      process.
      It is very easy to add a new file format to the compressor, modifying only
      one file and generating another.
    </p>
    <p>
      The core of the file recognition engine are the methods in the
      <code>traj_io.c</code> file.
      When a file is opened with <code>trajopen</code> method, different input
      modules are tried in order until we find a module that accepts this kind
      of file.
    </p>
    <p>
      The methods used to identify the files are stored in function pointer
      arrays:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>trjopen</code></li>
      <li><code>trjsnap</code></li>
      <li><code>trjFormatOK</code></li>
      <li><code>trjclose</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each array contains a pointer to the methods used to open, read,
      identify or close a format.
      This means that you must provide a new C code file that provides the code
      needed to open a file with the format you are interested in, the code
      needed to read a snapshot from a previously opened file, the code
      needed to identify a file with the format and the code needed to close
      a file with the format.
    </p>
    <p>
      Examples of this methods can be found in the <code>binpos_io.c</code>
      file, which contains the code needed to read binpos binary files.
